# Windows 12 Insider Preview
The insider preview version of the Windows 12 concept on PenguinMod.
> :memo: **NOTE:** I just want to say that this is not in any way affiliated with Microsoft. This is mainly just a concept.

# What is the Insider Preview?
In Windows, the Insider Preview is a version of Windows that is updated each time a **BETA** feature
is introduced. Basically, it gives you a preview of the features. Each Windows version has an Insider Preview.

## Installation
Go to the releases tab as always, find the latest version (or prerelease if you want), and download the "pmw12ip-v(version, ex. I.12)" zip file.
> :memo: **NOTE:** If your not sure which is the real PenguinMod Windows 12 Insider Preview, check every one you find. The latest version will always be in the "What's new in this version?" section below, or make sure the name of the zip is the same."

Extract it, then run "ipw12v(version).exe". It should look like the Windows 12 concept logo. (Win Vista logo)

## What's new in this version?

- Nothing!!! (not released yet)

### dev tasks!!!
